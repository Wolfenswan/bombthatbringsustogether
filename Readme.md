We made this game during the Game Makers Toolkit Jam 2021. The theme was "chained together". The art (by Anna) is all hand-drawn watercolor. Game design and coding by me and Arne.

Despite usual jam-wonkyness we are really happy with the result. If there's one hindsight we wouldn't have wasted time on trying to get the chain work using Unity's built-in features and rather just code it ourselves
